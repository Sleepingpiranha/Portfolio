        <P>Hydralisks are a Zerg Unit from the game series Starcraft.</P>
        <p>They are the closest the Zerg Swarm has to an elite unit, being used for defending important locations and entities as well as attacking like any other underling in the Swarm.</p>
        <p>Despite their appearance, their primary role is that of a ranged attacker, as within their crests are poisoned quills they are able to launch at speeds sufficient to punch through a Terran Marine's power armor.</p>
        <p>Like all Zerg units, they are purely biological and their genetics were taken from one or more creatures to creature what one would eventually know as a Hydralisk. And other zerg units, they are able to regenerate wounds, quickly dig, form a chrysalis to evolve when the leader has found good DNA in integrate into the hydralisks, or morph into a different Zerg unit; either a Lurker or Impaler.</p>
        <p>In regards to they physiology, they are worm or serpentine creatures with an outer exoskeleton, have two scythe-like arms, and a crested head. As stated before, they are able to fire quills out from their crest, possibly by using pressurized air to proppel them and due to the Zerg's regenerative capabilities, they functionally never run out of ammo. On their underside, they have specialized muscels that vibrate to shift the ground under them to allow them to dig underground with greater ease.</p>
