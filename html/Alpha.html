        <P>The Thrumbo is an herbivorous animal from the game Rimworld.</P>
        <p>They are mostly passive and are said to be the wisest creatures in the universe. They have been known to eat entire trees similar to the Alpha Beavers, however unlike said pests, they neither deforest entire areas nor will harm Anima Trees</p>
        <p>They are prized for their strong and sharp horns and beautiful, yet durable pelts, leading some to hunt them for said resources. A dangerous thing to do due to their size, strength, speed and their horn, many an unprepared or overconfident hunters have met their end from getting cut and trampled by their would be prey.</p>
        <p>While they are very smart and presumably wiser than humans, they can be tamed. In such events the Thrumbo is is capable of acting as a beast of burden, fighter, and will even rescue the wounded and bring them someplace where they can recieve adiquate medical care.</p>
        <p>Finally onto the phyiology, they are large, almost giraffe-like animals covered in long white fur on their backs, shorter silvery fur on their underside, and crowned with a large, scythe shaped horn. Their long necks allows them to reach the top of a tree to eat it from the top down, wasting less and acting more dignified. There is no notable difference between a male and female Thrumbo minus the fact that as mammals, the female likely lactates to feed the newly born offspring.</p>
