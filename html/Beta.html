        <P>The Odogaron is a wyvern from the game Monster Hunter World.</P>
        <p>Despite being the Rotten Vale's apex predator, they are odd, as they are scavengers more than hunters. But despite this, they are extremely aggressive, especially when in the prescence of scavanged meat. While not particularly strong in the relative comparison of wyverns, their are very fast and agile like most of the Fanged Wyvern catagory.</p>
        <p>As was stated before, they are primarily scavengers, eating the corpses of Wyverns that went to the Rotten Vale to die. However, going by their sheer aggression, it would be safe to assume that competition for the best and freshest meat is especially fierce with their co-habitees, the Girros, Great Girros, and other Odogarons.</p>
        <p>Due to their envirnment and the high quantities of the airborne bacteria known as Effluvium, they breathe with raspy breaths, so while they may be more resistant to the necrotic effects of Effluvium, they aren't immunne. And lacking much in the way of fat and insulating skin, they are very weak to shocks and paralytics, something the Girros evolved to abuse and many Hunters employ to fight them.</p>
        <p>While fighting an Odogaron, endurance and patience is key if one cannot keep up with their movements as they are more sprinters than marathon runners. Their fast movements and long leaps will quickly tire them out, eventually slowing them down or creating an opening. However, while not as physically powerful as the apex predators in other areas, they do have one cruel adaptation: their upper claws are roughly serated, so any cuts from them are likely to bleed more profusely than others and potions struggle to stitch back those wounds, normally requiring concentrated effort on the part of the hunter or another to close the wound so that the potion can more adiquately heal the wound.</p>
        <p>Now, in regards to physiology. Being Fanged Wyverns, they differ from the normal draconic visage one would normally imagine upon hearing "wyvern", no, they are more like massive, flayed wolves. As one could assume from my inclusion of "flayed", they are covered in hard, sinusus muscle rather than thick skin or scales. However, that muscle is hard and more resistant than one would assume. Their tails are large and end in a similarly large bony extrusion with each bone acting as another blade when the Odogaron uses it as a weapon, however, unlike most monsters, the extrusion can be eventually healed after having been cut off. Their paws have two sets of claws, with the second being their longer, serated claws, these can be pulled up against the leg when not in use, possibly because those claws aren't as durable as the more normal ones.</p>
