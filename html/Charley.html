        <P>The Primal Aspid is a predatorial insect in the game Hollow Knight once thought to be extinct.</P>
        <p>These insects plaguing the next vessel in its journey to replace its sibling are a significant threat in groups and to a lesser extent, alone.</p>
        <p>Being blessed with the ability to fly, they dart around, keeping the Vessel in range of their acid spray while being safer from its attacks. Their acid spray shoots out three globs of acid, the second most angled one being aimed at the Vessel to make dodging difficult.</p>
        <p>They are the predecessors to the more common Aspids like Aspid Hunters, however, they are in all but numbers superior to their genetic decsendants. Similar to how modern avians are descended from dinosaurs. Possibly because the most dangerous ones were hunted, leaving the weaker ones to reproduce and thus the species fell in their lethality.</p>
        <p>Physiologically, they are bee shaped with a white horned mask as their head and their abdomen filled with their orange acid. They possess six small wings and legs, connecting their head, abdomen, wings and legs is a dark purple thorax.</p>
