            <P>I am Sleepingpiranha, a gamer who's favorite game is Rimworld.</p>
            <p>Some of the other things I like to do are read and write. I sadly was not blessed with a competency in drawing, but I would like to try wood carving.</p>
            <p>I collect miniatures from tabletop war games such as Warhammer 40k and Battletech, although, I do yet need to paint most of my models.</p>
            <p>While playing games, I like looking at the fauna within noting what details I can. Above are some examples, I may add more or add onto those in the future.</p>
